As an [ODI Fellow](https://www.odi.org/odi-fellowship-scheme) and Economist I was embedded for three years as a civil servant in the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on MDGs. Under the leadership of [Amina Mohammed](https://www.un.org/sg/en/dsg/index.shtml) the office developed a politically-aware approach to reform which transformed public service delivery for millions of Nigerians. The Conditional Grants Scheme supported technocrats in state governments to make sure public investments were completed and operational. The OPEN monitoring and evaluation platform set new standards for involving civil society in the supervision of government activity. The [MDGs Baseline Facility Analysis](http://nmis.mdgs.gov.ng//) collected - for the first time - detailed data on every clinic and school in the country, allowing a systematic diagnosis and targeting of public service challenges.
